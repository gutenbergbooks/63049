<p><span class="scr_hidden">T</span>he house
in which
Mr. Bondy
lives is
large and
roomy.
It stands
on a knoll or
little hill, and
has green grass and bright pretty
flowers all around it. There are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[ 8 ]</span>
also trees, some for shade and
some for fruit.</p>

<p>But it is not about the house
or the garden that I wish to tell
you now. You may laugh when
I say that I want to talk to you
about the <span class="allsmcap">GARRET</span> of the house.</p>

<p>"O, Mr. Robin Ranger," say
you, "what is there about the
garret that will make a pleasant
story for me to read? Don't the
rats and mice live in the garret?
It is not a nice place: cold in
winter, and hot in summer."</p>

<p>But stop a moment, Master
Flurry, (if that is your name.)
Isn't there a garret to your
house? And don't you go there
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[ 9 ]</span>
sometimes to play, or to find
something that has been put in
the rag bag? If you do not, I
think your sister does, and you
may call her, if you think you
do not want to read about a garret,
and see if she will not like it.</p>

<p>But I suppose that as you have
read so far, you think you may
as well go on and find out what
the story is about.</p>

<p>Mr. Bondy's garret was quite
large. It had four small windows
in it, two at each end, so
that there was plenty of light.
There was also a chimney between
each pair of windows.</p>

<p>On the floor of the garret there
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[ 10 ]</span>
was a little of everything: old
bedsteads and chairs waiting to
be mended; trunks, valises, and
carpet-bags ready for traveling;
rolls of spare carpet, matting,
and oil cloth; two or three
stoves, put out of sight for the
summer; hats in bandboxes, and
boots without any boxes; rag
bags, and bags without any rags.</p>

<p>Yet there was no disorder on
the floor. Mrs. Bondy was a
neat and careful woman, and she
had everything in her house,
even in the garret, put in order
and kept so. Her motto was,
"A place for everything, and
everything in its place." Hence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[ 11 ]</span>
the floor of the garret was kept
clean, and the various things I
have named were stowed away
where they might be found when
wanted.</p>

<p>There was a rope stretched
across one end of the garret, and
on this rope were hung old clothes
to be given to the poor, and winter
clothes not now in use. Nails
were also driven into the rafters,
which, I suppose you know, are
the beams or long pieces of wood
just under the roof. From these
nails there hung little bundles
of last year's herbs: mint, sage,
thyme, catnip, pennyroyal, and
summer savory. These gave
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[ 12 ]</span>
to the garret a very pleasant
smell.</p>

<p>Against one of the chimneys
there stood a set of shelves which
had once been used in the kitchen;
but when the kitchen was
made larger, new shelves were
put in, and these old ones were
sent up garret, where old papers
and books were piled on
them.</p>

<p>I must not forget to tell you
that on and under an old table
with a broken leg there were
some toys: dolls, some with
broken heads, and some with
broken arms; toy cats that
couldn't squeak, and dogs that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[ 13 ]</span>
had long ceased to bark; a company
of soldiers that had once
been able to stand up together,
but now looked as if they had
been in the wars. The captain
had lost his head, and most of
the men had lost either an arm
or a leg.</p>

<p>There was also a little cradle
with one rocker off, and a small
cart with only one wheel. There
was a Noah's ark that had once
been filled with animals and
with Noah's family&mdash;wooden animals
and wooden people; but
the lid of the ark was gone, as
though a great wind had blown
it away, and the animals and people
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[ 14 ]</span>
were scattered, with broken
limbs and heads, about the
floor.</p>

<p>These toys had been nice and
new once, but they had been
used as all other toys are, and
did not long stand the wear and
tear of young hands. They were
still good enough to play with
once in a while, and thus were
put up in the garret, while the
newer and better toys were kept
below, some in the nursery and
a few in the parlor.</p>

<p>And now you begin to think
there must be some children in
Mr. Bondy's house, for he and
his good wife would not play
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[ 15 ]</span>
with dolls, and toy cats, and
wooden soldiers.</p>

<p>And you are right. There were
children there, and I am glad of
it, because a house without any
children in it is too dull and
quiet, and is not as pleasant as a
house in which are the pattering
of little feet, and the laughter of
merry little hearts, and the smiles
of happy little faces. A house
without children is like a garden
without buds.</p>

<p>If you want to know something
of these children, read the
next chapter.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="scr_hidden">T</span>here were
three of
them. Alice,
Maggie,
and
James
were their
names, and
they were generally well-behaved
and kind to each other. This
they were taught to be by their
parents.</p>

<p>Alice was ten years old and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[ 17 ]</span>
went to school. So did Maggie,
who was three years younger.
But James, who was only four
years old, was too young to go
to school, though he had learned
a few of his letters from his
sisters.</p>

<p>If I should say that these three
little Bondies loved to play, you
would not think it strange, would
you? Play! Why, I should not
like to see children that did not
love to play. I should think
they were sick, or else had lost
some of their senses.</p>

<p>I have seen children that did
not love to work or to study, but
I never yet saw one that did not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[ 18 ]</span>
love to play. I should as soon
expect to see a squirrel that
couldn't jump, or a bird that
couldn't fly, or a mouse that
couldn't run.</p>

<p>Yes, they loved to play; and
I ought to say just here that they
were willing to work and to study
as far as they could. Alice and
Maggie tried hard to get their
lessons for school, and even little
James would have studied his
spelling-book if his father had
not thought him too young.</p>

<p>Alice sometimes helped her
mother work in the kitchen, and
Maggie thought she did the same,
but I don't think her help
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[ 19 ]</span>
amounted to much. Master Jimmy
loved to work, also. But his
work made more work for older
folks. So his father thought one
day, when he came home and
found the young beets and parsnips
all pulled out of their beds
in the garden.</p>

<p>"Who did that?" said he to
the children.</p>

<p>"I did, papa," said little James.</p>

<p>"And what did you do that
for?"</p>

<p>"<i>I was working in the garden!</i>"
was the little fellow's reply.</p>

<p>He thought he was helping
his papa. What do you think?</p>

<p>The children had a very good
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[ 20 ]</span>
place to play in, for the garden
was large, and there was a good
sized plot of grass; and, besides,
not very far from the house there
was a grove of beautiful maple-trees,
under the shade of which
they sometimes had a picnic.</p>

<p>But when it rained they could
not play in the garden, or on the
grass, or under the trees. They
had to stay in the house.</p>

<p>Then it was that the garret
was used. It was a good place
to play in on a rainy day in summer.
In winter it was too cold.</p>

<p>At such times the children
took some of their good toys
with them from the nursery, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[ 21 ]</span>
used them with the old toys in
the garret. And though they
could not go out doors, they had
fine fun and frolic under the
roof of the house, and made noise
enough to frighten all the mice
away, if there had been any
there.</p>

<p><span class="scr_hidden">O</span>ne Saturday
in July the
children had
expected to
take a ride
with Abby
Mapes and her
brother Mark.
Mr. Mapes's man
Sam was to drive the wagon, and
they were going to the "Silver
Spring," as it was called, a beautiful
spring of water about three
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[ 23 ]</span>
miles from Mr. Bondy's house,
and not far from Mark Mapes's
uncle's, where the children were
all expected to take tea, and Sam
was to bring them home by dark.</p>

<p>They had talked it over for
several weeks; but at last, when
the long-looked for day came,
rain came with it.</p>

<p>Rain was very good for the
gardens, but not very good for
visiting; and the children had to
stay at home disappointed.</p>

<p>They were very sorry they
could not go, but they made no
noise about it. They tried to
make the best of it. They hoped
it might stop raining by noon.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[ 24 ]</span>
They would still be in time, for
they had not expected to start
before three o'clock.</p>

<p>But noon came without any
signs of clear weather. So, after
dinner, Mark Mapes came over
to say that his father would let
Sam take them next Saturday.</p>

<p>Before Mark went back, Alice,
who had been for some time
thinking how to pass away the
afternoon, went to her mother
and whispered: "Shall I tell
Mark to ask Abby to come over
here this afternoon and play with
me?"</p>

<p>"You may, if you wish," replied
her mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[ 25 ]</span></p>

<p>Alice ran to the door, which
Mark had by this time reached
on his way out, and gave him
her message for his sister.</p>

<p>As the house was only a short
distance from Mr. Bondy's, Mark
was soon back again, trying, as
best he could, to hold a big umbrella
over Abby's head. He
felt very large, but he could not
manage the umbrella very well.
He was only six years old, and
hardly strong enough. Besides,
his sister was so much taller than
he, that the points of the umbrella
often caught in her hood,
and nearly tore it from her head.</p>

<p>They were hardly seated before
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[ 26 ]</span>
Alice asked her mother if
they might not go up garret and
play a while. She told them
"Yes," and they all started up
stairs.</p>

<p>Alice and Maggie stopped a
moment in the nursery to get
some dolls and other toys, while
Abby took little Jimmie by the
hand and helped him along.</p>

<p>When they reached the garret
they were soon at their play.
The old toys were taken from
the table, and, with the new
ones, made enough to keep them
busy all the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mark and Jimmie found some
little blocks, and had great sport
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[ 27 ]</span>
in building houses out of them,
and knocking them down. They
also took the cart with one wheel
and loaded it with their blocks,
and amused themselves in drawing
the load from one end of the
garret to the other.</p>

<p>The girls went to work at
housekeeping. They had dishes,
and pots, and pans, some made
of china, some of wood, and some
of pewter. There were hardly
two whole ones in the lot. Nearly
all were either cracked, or
broken, or bent.</p>

<p>Alice had a very nice set of
china dishes, and Maggie had a
set of smaller ones, which had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[ 28 ]</span>
been given to them by Uncle
Fred for their last Christmas
present. But these they kept
on the corner stand in the parlor,
and did not very often use.</p>

<p>After a while the boys got
tired of carrying blocks in a cart
with only one wheel, so they
hunted around for something
else.</p>

<p>They found some of the animals
belonging to Noah's ark,
and two or three of the people.
But whether Noah and his
wife were among them I cannot
say.</p>

<p>They also found a tin trumpet
and a wooden whistle. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[ 29 ]</span>
trumpet was bent, and the whistle
a little cracked; but still
there was enough <i>squeak</i> left in
them to make a noise. But such
a noise! It sounded as if both
trumpet and whistle had been
out in the rain, and had become
hoarse with a cold.</p>

<p>Mark and Jimmie marched up
and down the garret, making all
the noise they could, and scraping
their feet across the floor.
By and by they sat down for a
moment on a small trunk to
rest.</p>

<p>When they rose from the
trunk, Mark moved it a little
with his foot. He stooped to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[ 30 ]</span>
put it back in its place, and as
he did so he saw something on
the floor behind it, and cried
out:</p>

<p>"Hey! Jimmie, look here!
Isn't this the wheel that belongs
to the cart?"</p>

<p>As he said this, he picked up
from the floor the missing wheel.
How it ever got behind the trunk
I don't know; but there it was,
and the boys were not long in
putting it on the axle.</p>

<p>Abby found a small nail on
the floor, and put it in the end
of the axle to keep the wheel on.
Then the old cart had two wheels,
and did the work much better
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[ 31 ]</span>
than when it went dragging along
with only one.</p>

<p>There was one very pretty thing
that the girls brought up stairs
to play with, that I must tell you
about. But I really do not know
the name of it. The lady who
made it and gave it to Alice
called it, I think, a <i>boudoir</i>.
What an odd name, isn't it!
Can you pronounce it?</p>

<p>It was a little table about the
size and shape of one half of a
dinner-plate, the back being
straight, and the front round.
It was made of wood, and had
three legs. The hind leg was put
in the middle of the straight back,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[ 32 ]</span>
and went up some distance from
the top of the table, like a pole.</p>

<p>The table and the pole were
covered with blue muslin, which
was neatly fastened on the top
of the table, and hung down like
an apron all around. A piece
of the same also went from the
top of the pole to the ends of
the back part of the table.</p>

<p>Then this blue muslin was all
covered with white lace. Thus
the table had a lace top over it,
a lace apron in front of it, and
lace curtains hanging from the
top of the pole, and nicely fastened
with ribbons at each corner
of the back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[ 33 ]</span></p>

<p>On the pole, a short distance
from the table, there hung a cunning
little looking-glass with a
gilt frame.</p>

<p>There were several things on
the table: a pincushion, a white
china wash bowl and pitcher, a
square scent bottle, also of white
china, with something in it that
smelled sweetly, and a tiny glass
bottle of cologne water.</p>

<p>It was really a beautiful toy,
and all who saw it were well
pleased with it. Alice did not
often play with it, but she saw
it as she passed through the
nursery on her way up stairs,
and thought it would be a nice
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[ 34 ]</span>
thing to take with her. It
looked all the better in the garret,
because there were so many
old, and broken, and ugly-looking
things around it.</p>

<p><span class="scr_hidden">T</span>hus they
played
along for
two or three
hours, and had
as good a time
as if the sun were
shining, and they out
in the garden.</p>

<p>The little dolls were
dressed and undressed, put into
the old broken cradle, and taken
out again, I don't know how
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[ 36 ]</span>
many times. The <i>boudoir</i> was
set on one of the shelves I have
told you about, and was looked
at, but was not handled much,
for Alice was very careful of it.
The plates and dishes were put
on the table and taken off, and
put on again, and at last all
thrown together in a box under
the table.</p>

<p>I forgot to tell you about the
swing which Mr. Bondy had put
up in the garret for the children.
It was a stout rope, and hung
from the rafters, where it was
tightly fastened. An old cushion,
which had once been on an
arm-chair, served as the seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[ 37 ]</span></p>

<p>When they were tired of their
other plays they got on the
swing; and when they were
tired of swinging they went back
to their dolls and dishes, tin
trumpet and old cart.</p>

<p>By and by they became tired
of the garret, and Alice said:</p>

<p>"Come, let's go down stairs
again."</p>

<p>"Sister," said Maggie, "let's
have one more swing."</p>

<p>"I want another swing, too,"
said Jimmie.</p>

<p>So on the swing they went
again. They had not swung long
before they heard a step on the
stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[ 38 ]</span></p>

<p>"O," said Alice, "there comes
father."</p>

<p>They were not afraid to have
him come, for he often played
with them, and loved to see them
enjoy themselves. He had come
home from business earlier than
usual on account of the rain, and
when he found that the children
were in the garret he went up
to see them.</p>

<p>As soon as his head was seen
above the garret floor, as he
came up stairs, Maggie cried
out:</p>

<p>"O papa, come give me a
swing, and tell me a story, and
let me sit in your lap!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[ 39 ]</span></p>

<p>"Well, well, miss," said Mr.
Bondy laughing, "I think you
are asking a great deal at once.
I can't swing you, and hold you
in my lap, and tell you a story
all at the same time."</p>

<p>"Well, swing me now," said
Maggie, "and then tell me a
story."</p>

<p>While Maggie was on the
swing they were all startled by
a singular noise coming from the
chimney. They had heard it
when they first came up garret,
but it was not so loud. They
would have gone down stairs
then in fear, but they waited a
moment, and, as it did not come
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[ 41 ]</span>
again, they went on with their
play and soon forgot it.</p>

<p>But now it became quite loud,
and if Mr. Bondy had not been
there they would have all run
down stairs. But they were not
afraid while he was by.</p>

<p>It was a strange noise, and I
can hardly tell you what it was
like, unless it was like something
rolling down the chimney.</p>

<p>"What is that?" said Abby
as she started toward the stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Bondy smiled and said:
"Don't be afraid, children, there
is nothing here to hurt you."</p>

<p>"But what made the noise,
papa," said Alice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[ 41 ]</span></p>

<p>"What would you think," said
her father, "if I should tell you
that the noise is made by the
folks that live in the chimney?"</p>

<p>"Folks in the chimney!" said
Mark Mapes. "How could anybody
live there?"</p>

<p>"O papa is only teasing us
with one of his riddles," said
Alice. "But there, that's the
same noise again. I wish I knew
what made it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Mr. Bondy,
"the old folks have been out to
market, and are just coming
home with something for the
children to eat."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[ 42 ]</span></p>

<p>At this they all laughed. Presently
Alice said: "O, I know
what you mean! There's a
bird's nest there, and it's the old
birds that make the noise with
their wings."</p>

<p>"How could little birds live
in the chimney, I should like to
know?" said Maggie. "I should
think the smoke would get in
their eyes and drive them out."</p>

<p>"But they do live there," said
her father. "Alice has guessed
right. There is no doubt a nest
of swallows somewhere in the
chimney. The old birds go out
and get flies, and bring them
to the little birds, who open their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[ 43 ]</span>
mouths while the old ones drop
them in."</p>

<p>"Isn't that funny," said little
Jimmie, who had heard all that
was said.</p>

<p>"Papa," said Maggie, "won't
you tell us some more about the
swallows?"</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you a swallow
story?" he asked.</p>

<p>"O yes, do, do," all the children
said.</p>

<p>"Then you must all sit down,
and be very still."</p>

Alice
took a
seat on
an old
trunk; Mark
and Jimmie sat
on the floor; and
Mr. Bondy got an old
chair, with the back
broken, and took his seat on it,
holding Maggie in his arms.</p>

<p>When they were all quiet he
began:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[ 45 ]</span></p>

<p>"A little girl named Jane
Clark once went with her mamma
to visit her grandma in the
country. During the night Mrs.
Clark was several times wakened
by strange noises about the chimney
of the room where she slept.
But Jane was so tired that she
slept too soundly to hear anything.</p>

<p>"Once Mrs. Clark sat up in
bed as the noise came louder
than usual, and she saw, by the
light of the night-lamp, a bundle
of straw tumble down from the
chimney into the fireplace. The
straw had been put into the
chimney, which was never used
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[ 46 ]</span>
for a fire, to keep the cold wind
from blowing down.</p>

<p>"The noise now stopped, and
Mrs. Clark went to sleep. Early
next morning Jane jumped out
of bed, and as she touched the
floor a little bird started from
a corner of the room, and flew
frightened toward the window.
But it could not get through, for
the window was shut.</p>

<p>"After flying all around the
room until it was tired, the bird
was caught by Mrs. Clark, who
let Jane hold it carefully in her
hand.</p>

<p>"Its nest was near the top of
the chimney, and somehow or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[ 47 ]</span>
other it had fallen down during
the night upon the straw which
stopped up the chimney. It
tried to fly up again, but could
not. Each time it tried it fell
back on the straw, until it loosened
the bundle, which fell with
it to the floor.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clark looked at it very
carefully, but could not find any
bruise upon it. Jane at first
wanted her mother to get a cage,
and let her take it home. But
when her mother told her that
the poor little thing would die
if shut up in a cage, Jane was
willing to let it go.</p>

<p>"She took it again in her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[ 48 ]</span>
hand, and gently smoothed down
the feathers on its head and back.
She then opened the window,
and kissing it on its bill, said:
'Go, little birdie, go, and find
your nest again.' And the swallow
spread its little wings and
soon was out of sight."</p>

<p><span class="scr_hidden">"T</span>hat was a
pretty story,
papa," said
Maggie.</p>

<p>"Wont
you tell
us another?"</p>

<p>"Not
this time, I
guess, my child. But tell me:
how would you like to live in a
chimney?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[ 50 ]</span></p>

<p>The children laughed at this,
and said that it was not possible.</p>

<p>"Well, then, how would you
like to live in a garret?" asked
Mr. Bondy.</p>

<p>Of course they none of them
cared to do that.</p>

<p>"It would be too cold in winter,"
said Abby.</p>

<p>"And too hot in summer,"
said Alice.</p>

<p>"And too dark all the time,"
said Mark.</p>

<p>"I should be afraid of the rats
and mice," said Maggie.</p>

<p>"I would shoot them with my
gun," said Jimmie, who was very
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[ 51 ]</span>
bold when there were no rats
and mice to be seen.</p>

<p>"But, my children," said Mr.
Bondy, "there are many poor
people who have not as comfortable
a place as this garret to live
in. I have seen them sometimes
in a garret with no bed but a
heap of shavings or straw to lie
on, and no covering but an old,
ragged, and dirty quilt. The
roof has been leaky and the floor
wet with snow or rain, and the
wind blowing across the garret,
making every one shiver with
the cold.</p>

<p>"O it is a sad sight to see a
poor sick woman lying in such a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[ 52 ]</span>
place, and dying for want of food,
while her children are lying
around her in rags, and dirt, and
cold, crying for bread which the
mother has not to give.</p>

<p>"You ought to thank God,
children, who gives you food,
and clothing, and kind friends,
and a comfortable house to live
in; and we ought to help the poor
and the sick all that we can."</p>

<p>The children felt sad when
they heard about the poor who
suffer thus, and Alice said she
was sure she would like to help
them if there were any such living
near.</p>

<p>But by this time the rain had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[ 53 ]</span>
stopped. There was a little blue
sky in the west, and soon the
golden sunshine came through
the garret windows, casting its
pleasant light across the floor,
and making the old toys and
broken furniture look brighter
and better than they did when
all was dark and gloomy.</p>

<p>Presently the tea bell rang,
and they hastened down stairs.
They had enjoyed a pleasant
afternoon in spite of the rain.
Perhaps, if the weather had been
fine, and they had gone to the
Silver Spring, they might have
had a pleasanter time; but then,
as Alice said at the tea-table,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[ 54 ]</span></p>

<p>"We should not have heard
that story about the swallow, nor
about the poor people that suffer
so much in the cold. I wish I
could help them."</p>

<p>"Besides," said Abby, "we can
all go to the Silver Spring next
Saturday, if it is pleasant; Sam
will take us."</p>

<p>And so he did, for the next
Saturday was a very fine day,
and they all had a grand time.</p>

<p>Thus they enjoyed two pleasant
afternoons: one stormy one
in the garret, and one bright one
by the Silver Spring.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
